# MEMZ-Clean-


# What is MEMZ?

Memz is an virus, It is activated by a panel with some payloads.

However, if you are curious about how this virus works, and don't have knowledge about a Virtual Machine or Can't access one, This is for you.

# How to use

This version is a safe version of the orignal MEMZ Panel. To start the process, Simply click any of the buttons.

To do an emegency stop, Do Shift+Esc.

For an normal stop, Just click the button again.

Press CTRL+SHIFT+S to make some payloads faster.

If there are any things left on your screen even after you stopped the payload, Move your exe around where the stuff is. (This is automatic for an emergency stop)

Risky payloads are there in the exe, Its not actually risky but its a 30% chance you loose data temporary. These payloads give you a warning

Before activating it. So, pretty much thats it.
